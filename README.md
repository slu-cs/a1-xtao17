Overall comments on grading questions:

1) Does your site make the information easy to find?
    - Better than the original, but some things could still be easier.
    - The voter registration form is mentioned but not linked.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the registration/absentee deadlines in 2020.
    - I have to dig and do some math to find the early voting dates in 2020.

2) Are the pages reasonably structured with HTML?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Style tags traditionally go in the head, not the body.
    - Navigation links at the top would ideally be inside a nav.
    - Dates & deadlines seem well suited to present in table formats.
    - Lots of lists are structured as paragraphs instead of proper lists.
    - Arguably the list of people who work at the BoE should also be a list or table.

3) Are the pages tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
    - For the most part, yes.
    - Text in all-caps is generally hard to read.
    - The navigation area would ideally have a different background to set it apart from the content.
    - The navigation buttons don't have active-link highlighting, so visitors can't keep track of where they are.
